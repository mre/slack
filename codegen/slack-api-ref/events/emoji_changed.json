  "long_desc": "The emoji_changed event is sent to all connections for a team when that team's custom emoji is updated. When they receive this event, clients may either process the subtype if present and of a known value or should update their local cache of emoji by calling the emoji.list method again. An emoji_changed event will always have an event_ts field specified in addition to type. subtype is optional and the presence of additional fields depends on subtype. An emoji_changed event may have a subtype specified. An absent subtype or unrecognized subtype should be handled by reloading all emojis via the emoji.list method. The following is the current list of defined subtypes: An emoji has been added to the team emoji list. Note that, like in emoji.list, value is either the URI to fetch the image from or an alias to an existing name as indicated by the alias: pseudo-protocol. One or more emojis have been removed from the team emoji list. Note that names is always an array of at least one name, and that aliased emoji entries are always removed when the emoji name they alias to is removed.",
